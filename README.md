 VitalGaze---AI-Based-Facial-Toxication-Skin-Analysis🏥💻

A Python-based real-time tool for assessing facial health using AI and image processing.

📌 Overview

Facial Health Analyzer is designed to evaluate facial health indicators through computer vision techniques, allowing real-time detection of:

✅ Pimples & Skin Redness – Utilizes image processing to assess skin health
✅ Eye Droopiness – Detects signs of fatigue and potential drowsiness
✅ Intoxication Detection – Analyzes eye openness and facial redness to determine possible intoxication
✅ Live Webcam Monitoring – Provides instant results through real-time facial analysis

This application is developed using OpenCV, MediaPipe, Tkinter, and NumPy, featuring an interactive and easy-to-use interface.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, Tkinter, PIL

Frameworks: None (Pure Python)
