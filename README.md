# VitalGaze---AI-Based-Facial-Toxication-Skin-Analysis 🏥💻  
_A real-time facial health assessment tool using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and AI._

---

## 📌 Overview
VitalGaze---AI-Based-Facial-Toxication-Skin-Analysis is a Python-based application that detects various facial health indicators, including:

✅ **Pimples & Skin Redness** – Utilizes image processing to assess skin health 
✅ **Eye Droopiness** – Detects signs of fatigue and potential drowsiness  
✅ **Toxication Detection** – Analyzes eye openness and facial redness to determine possible intoxication 
✅ **Live Webcam Monitoring** – Provides instant results through real-time facial analysis

This application is developed using `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, `Tkinter`, and `NumPy`, featuring an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
